## Description
WorkmanTrak is a node application for maintaining a companies employee database.

    The motivation behind the WorkmanTrak application was to better familiarize myself with mysql and querying with the sql language.

    WorkmanTrak aims to provide a company with an easy to use interface for updating and maintaining their departments, roles, and employees.

    The development of WorkmanTrak was a bit arduous. It has certainly been the most challenging application I have built to date. Understanding and properly querying databases is such a useful skill, but it takes time to really master!

WorkmanTrak starts with a custom Database Class. This is where I have built the methods needed to utilize the database. As you can see below we have a method to connect, query, and drop connection.<br/>
